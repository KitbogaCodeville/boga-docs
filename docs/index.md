## Contribution
---
To contribute to this guide, please view the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/KitbogaCodeville/boga-docs/). The docs are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/). Editing can be done in browser, or for users familiar with Git, on a local machine. Once you have made changes, submit your fork as a pull request to the main repository. Your edits will be reviewed by the community and added if they receive support.

### Local Editing
#### Prerequisites
```plaintext
python
pip
mkdocs
```
Pip should be installed by default on modern Python installations. To install `mkdocs`, use `pip install --upgrade mkdocs` in your command line.

#### Editing
We recommend you fork the main repository, then clone and edit in your preferred plaintext editor (Notepad++, Sublime, VSCode, etc.). You can view your changes using `mkdocs serve`. This will start a live-reload server on http://localhost:8000. Once you are happy with your changes, push them back to GitHub, and submit your pull request.
